In our assignment we have implemented RAG application based on what we have learned during the course. Our dataset contains resumes of different people in several distinct fields. The application focuses on embedding these resumes and storing the embeddings in a vector database. We load these embeddings for our GPT model and use it to answer different types of job position related questions. We have made 3 different types of prompts, and the model behaves differently in each of them. Lastly we created a simple Gradio interface, where user(companies) can type in their desired query/question and get the most relevant people for the job recommended.
